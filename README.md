This repository contains a demo implementation of a timer that is resistant to shifting. It uses a simple algorithm and tools available on most POSIX compliant systems, like Linux.

Original target of this algorithm was ZSun Card Reader running OpenWRT, though it can be used on any embedded device or more generally on any application that requires a real time timer.
